## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security using JWT
- Zuul gateway
- Eureka Server
- Microservices
- H2 database

## Project status

This is a project, we, a team of 3 junior software developers created from scratch, to learn 
Spring Boot, Security, Microservices. 
Project is at 70-75% ready, 
- Microservices 100%
- Security almost complete 95%
- Few user features missing.
We spent 4 weeks to build this app:
- 1st in one big monolit
- 2nd adding security
- 3rd recreating/separating the whole app to microservices (this took longer then expected, therefore
  some of the features were not implemented to focus instead on understanding the concept)
  
## Outcome

As a result, we can say that we managed to learn and understand:
- How to use microservices,
- How to implement JWT token based security in a Gateway Service
- How to communicate with a React fromtend(using tokens)
